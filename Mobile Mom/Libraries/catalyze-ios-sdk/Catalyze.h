/**
 catalyze.io iOS SDK BETA version 1.0.0
 
 The catalyze.io iOS SDK is the preferred way of interacting with the catalyze.io 
 API when developing for iOS.  Functionalities include user, session, custom classes and data, 
 as well as querying management.  You can also find a guide for developing with the catalyze.io
 iOS SDK on the github repo.  This guide walks you through some of the most common 
 ways to use the SDK with code examples.  
 
 This class allows you to set and get your app key, url scheme, and app id as well 
 as provides a single file that you import in any place you need to use the 
 catalyze.io iOS SDK.  No matter which part of the SDK you are using, simply 
 "#import Catalyze.h" at the top of the file.
 
 **NOTE:**
 Developers must set their app key, url scheme, and app id in 
 application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: or an exception will be thrown on the first network 
 request.
